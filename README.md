# Important Note for the people in charge,
Gemini API Key Removed
For security reasons, I’ve removed my Gemini API key from .env. The chatbot won’t function unless a new key is provided.

Images Placeholder
Since I didn’t have official photos related to BoscoMUN, I temporarily used Aryaman Bhaiya’s profile pic(sorry for this) wherever images were needed. This can be swapped later.

Contact Page is Functional 
The contact form is connected to a MongoDB cluster. You can verify this from the .env file and the backend logic in the /lib folder.

Committee Pages
Due to time constraints, I was only able to build two sample committee pages: ADHOC and UNSC. They represent the intended structure of the others.

Study Guide Links
The study guide buttons currently lead to placeholder 404 pages, as I did not receive the actual links.

Conference Details Section
The content written under "Conference Details" is mostly fictional and added for humor. It’s not meant to offend or target anyone, and should not be taken seriously. I simply did not have access to the actual conference or accommodation information.

Homepage UI Note
The homepage was built quickly (within ~1 hour), so its UI may not be as refined. Given more time, I’d focus on improving visual appeal - but the functional structure is complete.

No working links
The links except for the routes wont work. The study guides are under heavy construction and so there was no link to put in the website

Use of LMC Site Content& committee pics
I used reference data from the LMC MUN website to fill in missing content. I acknowledge that sir advised against this, but I lacked alternate sources.
there are no committee pictures in the link, just dummy pics of the committee logos
