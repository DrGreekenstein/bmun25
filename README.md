# Important Note for the people in charge,
I hv removed my GeminiAPI key from the .env, for security reasons, so the chatbot wont work unless provided with another key

also as i had no pic relating to the Bosco mun, i just put Aryaman bhaiya's dp everywhere i required a pic, sorry for this

also if you are wondering if the contact page actually works, yea it does, i hv a mongodb cluster connected to it, as you can see from the .env file and the model+backend logic in the /lib folder

also i havent made all the committees as there was a time constraint, but i hv made 2 committee pages-adhoc and asean, which show how the others would turn out if given more time 

The data used has been taken from the LMC website(ik sir told not to use it, but I did not have any other place to get info)

The links to study guides dont work as i did not hv the links, for now it will direct to a page which will throw a not found 404 error, 

The things i hv written in the Conference-details are purely fictious n just for humour, and is not made to target any specific individual and should not be taken personally
this was cuz, i didnt hv the details abt the conference and accomodation

The home page was built in a hurry within abt 1hr, so it has turned out to look appalling
